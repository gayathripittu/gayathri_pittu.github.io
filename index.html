									<h2>This is<br />
									Gayathri</h2>
								<p>Welcome to my Portfolio!<br />
									I'm a Computer Science graduate student with a strong foundation in software development and data analysis.
								</p>

								<p><h4>Professional Experience</h4>
									I began my formal education in computer science at the Madanapalle Institute of Technology and Science, India, where I graduated with a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering.To further enhance my skills, I pursued a Master of Science in Computer Science at Bowling Green State University in Ohio, USA. 
								</p>
								<p>
									During my time at Bowling Green State University, I focused on developing my expertise in two significant areas: Data Structures and Data Science. This period was marked by intensive coursework and projects that not only deepened my understanding but also allowed me to apply these skills in practical settings. Key courses included Secure Software Engineering, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, and Python for Computational Data Science, among others. My academic excellence was recognized with a full-time scholarship, reflecting my dedication and proficiency in my studies.  I received a full scholarship of $24,000 in recognition of my academic achievements, alongside a stipend of $21,000. 
								</p>


								<p><h4>Educational Background</h4>
									Transitioning from academia to the professional world, I joined Infosys Ltd as a Digital Specialist Engineer. Here, I leveraged tools like Azure Databricks, HIVE, and SQL to enhance data processing and analytics capabilities significantly. My work involved collaborating with cross-functional teams to improve ETL processes and ensure data integrity, which led to a notable reduction in downtime by 25%.  My role involved collaborative problem-solving, a key element in my professional development.</p>

									<h4>
										Continuous Learning Journey
									</h4>
									
									I am actively enhancing my skills in API Development, with a focus on RESTful APIs, Django, SQL, and Visual Studio Code. This ongoing learning is part of my commitment to staying current with the latest technologies and best practices in software engineering.<br>
My journey in API development began with the basics of Django, focusing initially on function-based views. As I progressed, I moved on to more complex features such as class-based views, mixins, generics, and viewsets. This portfolio showcases my learning journey in building APIs with Django. It highlights the various approaches I've explored to construct superior web applications with Django, starting from fundamental concepts to more advanced techniques.
<br>
<b>Current Focus:</b> I am currently deepening my knowledge of the Django REST Framework, exploring advanced features like mixins, generics, and viewsets to enhance data handling and application interactivity.<br>
You can explore my API development projects in more detail by going to the following section of my portfolio: <a href="API.html" style="color: blue;">API Projects</a>
</p>
								<p>
								<h4>Projects Overview</h4>
									
	I have taken part in several significant projects during my academic and professional career:
	<h5>Data Structures</h5>
	<p>
		The Data Structures section showcases my technical foundation in computer science. Here, I demonstrate how I apply, analyze, and optimize algorithms and data structures to solve programming challenges efficiently. Projects include implementations of complex algorithms like Dijkstra's for graph traversal and dynamic solutions for the coin-change problem, reflecting my analytical approach and problem-solving skills.<br>

				 <h5>Machine Learning (ML) Projects</h5>
				 <p>
					During my Master's program in Computer Science at Bowling Green State University, I developed a keen interest in Machine Learning. This section of my portfolio highlights the projects I completed during my coursework. These projects show how I've applied classroom learning to real-world data problems, using machine learning techniques. These projects helped me understand how to work with large datasets and apply machine learning models to predict outcomes and uncover insights. Each project demonstrates my growth in the field and my ability to use data to make informed decisions<br>
